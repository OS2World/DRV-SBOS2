The two files player.c and recorder.c are sample programs to create
and play .VOC files. They are not very polished programs, but should
work well enough.

Both programs give help if you just type their name. Both also
can play/record raw sound files if you use the -b switch.

If you have a SBPro then use Mixertool or setmixer to set the
recording source and the recording/playback levels.

Both can be compiled with EMX GCC 0.8e and the supplied GNU MAKE makefile.


The file VOCFILE.TXT has info on the .VOC file format. I don't know how
stereo .VOC files are stored.

The file COOLGUY.VOC is a sample file to play with.
