This is a newer version of the multithreaded tracker. I changed
all the memory allocation to use calls to the OS/2 API instead of
using malloc/free and it seems to have cleared up some of the problems.

Note that alot of debugging info gets spit out - if you have problem
and the program dies it would be helpful to have a copy of the output.

If you have the driver configured to SBREG then the output is always in
mono, no matter if you specify -stereo or not. On a SBPRO the output
is stereo by default.
