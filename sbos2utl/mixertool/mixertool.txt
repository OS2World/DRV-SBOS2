MIXERTOOL is a PM program to access the internal mixer on the SB Pro. It
WILL NOT work with a SB. It requires that the SBOS2.SYS device driver is
installed.

To run mixertool just type 'mixertool' at a OS/2 prompt, or double click
on the Program Object for mixertool.exe.

The program is pretty much self explanatory. The sliders control the volume
levels for the various inputs and outputs of the SB Pro. The radio buttons
control the recording source and whether or not certain filters are
enabled. Play around and you'll figure out how it all works.

Note that the CD IN is actually a stereo port, but mixertool treats it
as a mono input.

The 'REFRESH' button should be used if the mixer state is changed by another
program and you want to update the Mixertool display.

Building the program is not difficult. You will need GNU MAKE and the
EMX port of GNU GCC. Then run MAKE and everythign should compile.
You'll get a few warning errors which you can ignore. If I get a chance
I'll try to clean up the messages, but they are harmless.
