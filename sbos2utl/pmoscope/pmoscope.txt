This program displays real time input from the SB in a PM window. 
It is useful for setting the recording volume in conjunction with
mixertool so that the input signal is not too weak or strong.


To run pmoscope use the following commandline

PMOSCOPE sample_rate [buffer_size]

where
	 sameple_rate = sampling rate in Hz. This is a REQUIRED parameter.

	                A regular SB can go up to around 21500 HZ,
			while a SB Pro can reach 43400 hz. The	
                        higher the rate the more work the computer has to
                        do to display the data. It is possible that at high
                        sampling rates that the display skips over sections
                        of the input signal in order to keep up.

         buffer_size  = Input buffer size. This parameter is optional.

			The buffer size determines how many samples are plotted
			per screen update. The default is 512. Note that if
			buffer_size is greater than the number  of horizontal
			pixels in the display window then several data points
			are plotted per screen column.


You can resize the window while the display is active. A smaller
window will result in faster refresh. One screenful of data displays
(buffer_size/sample_rate) seconds of data, so if you set sample_rate to
42000 hz and buffer_size to 128 bytes, one screen full will display about
3 msec of data. 

I find that the songs on the first side of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon
are interesting to sample this way, in particular the synthesizer parts.
