Changes in V0.91
----------------

1) Correctly handle IRQ2.

2) Added QUIET option - loads driver without any output at bootup.

3) Added PAS16 option - loads driver, does not check for presence of soundcard.
                        Necessary since PAS 16 is not in SB mode at bootup.

4) Options no longer have to be in uppercase.

5) Added IOCtls to control DMA buffer size and handling of buffer
   overflows when sampling.
