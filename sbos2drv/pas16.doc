Notes for Using SBOS2 v0.91 with PAS 16 Sound Cards
Michael Fulbright


The PAS 16 card does not come up in SB emulation mode. There is a DOS
device driver which turns on this emulation called MVSOUND.SYS included
with your sound card.

When SBOS2.SYS loads with the PAS16 option it skips the check to make
sure a sound card actually exists. To use SBOS2 you have to enable the
SB emulation by running a DOS session that loads the driver MVSOUND.SYS.
Thats all, once you load that driver once everything is setup.

I don't recommend trying to run a program that uses SBOS2 while you
have the driver MVSOUND.SYS loaded. Currently SBOS2 isn't too smart
about DOS and Windows sessions, and problems can occur if you run two
programs that use the SB at the same time.

So it is probably best to load a DOS session in your Startup Folder
which will load MVSOUND.SYS and then exit. This way the SB emulation
gets enabled everytime you boot your machine.
